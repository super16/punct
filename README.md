# punct

SPA that clears input text from words, leaves only punctuation. Inspired by
[Clive Thompson's 'just the punctuation' project](https://medium.com/creators-hub/what-i-learned-about-my-writing-by-seeing-only-the-punctuation-efd5334060b1).
This application supports Russian language & expanded set of punctuation marks.

See [Demo](https://super16.github.io/punct/).
